<p>A Jekyll theme for blogging. With the ability to sort posts by category and list various authors in an authors block, this theme is perfect for collaborative projects.</p>

<h1>How to use it</h1>

<ol>
<li>Star &amp; fork the <a href="http://github.com/ninapetrop/Jekyll-Testing-Site">repo</a></li>
<li>Rename the repo and clone the master branch to your local directory</li>
<li>Customize the <code>_config.yml</code> file to represent you</li>
<li>Download Gulp to get the most out of this theme (compiling Jade/Sass, browser refresh etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>When using a local server</strong> change the url in the <code>_config.yml</code> to your server address. Make sure to change it back to your domain before you deploy.</p>

<h2>Author blocks</h2>

<p>Author blocks are populated based on each post in the <code>_posts</code> folder. The author <strong>name</strong>, <strong>title</strong>, <strong>bio</strong>, and <strong>social media</strong> links are all defined in the YAML at the top of ever post page.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re only going to feature posts from one author, or default to that author primarily, you can define these values in the <code>_config.yml</code> file, just like you do for url, and sitename. This will require you change the tags in the <code>_layouts/posts.html</code> file.</p>
